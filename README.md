## What is steganography?

<br/>

Steganography is data hidden within data.
Steganography is an encryption technique that can be used along with cryptography as an extra-secure method in which to protect data.

## What is this project about?

<br/>

Steghide4Android is an android app, that allow users to hide a secret message into an image. It can be used to store passwords or even exchange messages between partners in a very secure way.

<br/>

## How it works?

<br/>

For hidding the data, first, the message is passed to binary. Each bit of this bynary message is going to replace the "Last significant bit" of every pixel value(Also to binary) in the image. When changing the last significant bit of every pixel color value, the difference is so little, that it is nearly impossible to tell which image is the real one and which one is hidding a message.
